extended-description = """
zifu is a command line tool to fix Windows-dependent encoded filenames of ZIP files.

In general, only ASCII characters are allowed for file names in a ZIP archive. However, uninformed non-English Windows users may include files with names in their native languages. Unfortunately, the ZIP archiver in Windows implicitly encodes the file names in encodings other than UTF-8, so they are garbled when unzipped under Linux.
This tool automatically detects the encoding of the files in the ZIP archive and explicitly re-encodes them as UTF-8, so that you can unzip them without any garbled characters even with the ZIP archiver bundled in Linux."""
